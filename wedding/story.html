<h3>According to  Luisa...</h3>

<h3>According to Robbie...</h3>
<p>
	I met Luisa in June 2015. She was visiting Purdue and working with Professor Weiss. The first time I talked with her was during a friend’s master’s defense presentation. I drew a bird in my notebook and passed it to her. I asked her to guess the animal, and she guessed an elephant. I immediately liked her and thought she was funny. We worked together on few projects and around the lab together for a few weeks before I had the nerve to ask her to hang out outside of work. Our first date was to the Neon Cactus, which many Purdue people will tell you, is not the traditional place for a first date.
</p>
<p>
	In October 2015, we made a trip to New York City, mainly to visit the Colombian consulate so she could take a graduation exam. It was a great opportunity to travel and see some cool sights. I even got to meet some of her friends that were living in New York, but it was more like we crashed on their couches so we didn't have to pay for a hotel (thanks Susi and Tyler). We enjoyed the time in the city seeing her friends, being tourists and also getting shown around by NYC natives.
</p>

<p>
	The rest of October and November 2015 went by quickly in West Lafayette, as we had research and projects in which we were involved. I enjoyed that we could spend the holidays together with my family in Indianapolis, and I loved how easily it seemed that Luisa could become part of the family. In early 2016, Luisa helped me move to Corvallis, Oregon, so I could finish my PhD while working for Professor Weiss. Luisa and I enjoyed our drive across the United States, especially seeing our friends that were conveniently located along the way (again sleeping on their couches, thanks Nate and Emilee!). One of the memories I have from that trip was my first time holding a chicken, which was a little bit of a traumatic experience for me. I remember we had a good laugh, because as Luisa tells me Abuela Graciela kills chickens for dinner without problems! I guess that is one of the things I will need to learn when I go to visit. 
</p>
<p>
	Luisa returned to Colombia in January 2016. She had a few classes to finish her petroleum engineering degree. A long distance relationship was difficult, but we enjoyed regular emails and video calls and whatsapp messages. I even got added to the family whatsapp group! It's been a great way to get to know Luisa's family, and even though I feel like I know them so well, I can't wait to meet them in person. Even though I sometime have to use google translate for Tio Asdrubal's messages that are so long, and often have to rephrase my bad gringo espanol when I talk with Abuela, I feel that I have been welcomed into her family. The love I feel between her family, and how it reminds me of my own family, is one of the reasons that I decided that Luisa was the woman with whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life. 
</p>
<p>
	Luisa was able to come to visit for vacation in June 2016, and it was then I decided to ask her to be wife. I popped the question on nice day in August, after we made a grueling hike to an elevation of 10,300 feet to the top of South Sister mountain. I brought Cameron (the best man) and Chunyu (one of the ushers) along to get some pictures. She didn't have any idea I would be asking her! Kelsea told me I needed to plan something super romantic for the day of the proposal, so that is where the idea for a six hour hike came from (thanks sis!). We finished that evening almost losing Chunyu in the wilderness, taking a bath in a glacially-fed lake, cooking steaks, and camping.

	We were married at the Benton County courthouse in Corvallis, Oregon, on September 27, 2016. Now we are inviting friends and family to share with as we receive the Sacrament of Matrimony in the Catholic Church. I have been lucky to find a strong faith community here at St. Mary's in Corvallis, and I particularly enjoy the OSU campus ministry at the Newman Center. I am excited that we will be able to receive the Sacrament here at this community before we transition into the next stage of our lives, and I hope that you will be able to be here to celebrate with us.
