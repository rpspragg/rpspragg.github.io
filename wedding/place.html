<h3>Where to fly in to</h3>
	<p>
		There are three airports that are an option to fly into when coming to visit us in Corvallis. The easiest is Portland International (PDX airport code). A closer regional airport is available in Eugene (EUG airport code), although this might prove slightly more expensive. A third more distant option is flying in to Seattle, Washingtnon, (SEA airport code) but this option will require about a five hour drive south. It might be a good option if you want to see more of the Pacific Northwest!
	</p>
<h3>How to get to Corvallis</h3>
	<p>
		From SEA or EUG airports, your best bet will be to rent a car.
	</p>
	<p>
		From PDX, there are a couple of options. The first is renting a car. The second option is to take an uber or taxi to the Amtrak station in Portland, and take the Amtrak train to Albany, Oregon. Tickets for the train are about $17 each way. You can find more info at <a href="https://tickets.amtrak.com/itd/amtrak">AMTRAK</a> and searching between Portland, OR (PDX) and Albany, OR (ALY). If you do this option, let us know and we will find a way to get you from the Amtrak station in Albany to our place here in Corvallis, it is only about a ten minute drive. The third option is taking a shuttle, ther is the  <a href="https://www.hutshuttle.com/rates/index.php">HUT Shuttle</a> and <a href="http://www.oregonexpressshuttle.com/">Oregon Express Shuttle</a> that goes between PDX and Corvallis.
