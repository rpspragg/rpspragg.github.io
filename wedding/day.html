<h3>The Ceremony</h3>
<p>
	Our ceremony with be at the Chapel at the <a href="http://osunewman.org/">OSU Newman Center</a>. Father Ignacio Llorente will be presiding. Father Ignacio is a member of the <a href="https://www.socsj.org/">Saint John Society</a>, a group of Catholic missionaries from Argentina. We have been blessed to meet the Society here in Oregon, and we are excited that Father Ignacio will be able to preside over our ceremony. The ceremony will include a Catholic Mass, and for those that are not Catholic and have never attended a mass, please do not worry. Everyone present will be an important witness to the love that Luisa and I have for each other as we ask God to bless our union together.  The ceremony will be about an hour and a half, and there will be programs so everyone will be able to participate at the level at which they are comfortable. For Luisa and I, this will be one the most important moment of our lives, and we receive the Sacrament of Matrimony and invite God to be a part of our commitment to each other for the rest of our lives.  
</p>

<h3>The After Party</h3>
<p>
	Following the Mass, we will have a reception outside the Newman Center. The early summer weather in Corvallis has no comparison and we are expecting it to be in the mid 70s. In case of rain, we will transition to one of the indoor venues that is next door. The reception will consist of a light lunch of traditional Colombian food, so please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions. Following lunch, we will have music and dancing in the courtyard at the Newman Center.  
</p>

<h3>The Bike Ride</h3>
<p>
	Arond 3 pm, following the party, we are planning to have a bike procession to downtown Corvallis to continue the party. For our friends and family joining from out-of-town, there are options to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=bikerentals&find_loc=Corvallis%2C+OR">rent bikes</a>. If you don't feel comfortable riding a bike, or are unable to find an option to rent, downtown is a short walk away (15 minutes) or there are plenty of parking spots. On the day, we will have a more defined plan so we can plan the meet at downtown.
</p>
<h3>The After After Party</h3>
<p>
	Corvallis is known for their many craft breweries, a wide selection of eateries, and an awesome downtown area. We hope to make our way around all of our favorite places, and share with you the place that we have come to call our home!
