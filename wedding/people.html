<h3> The Groomsmen</h3>
	<h4>Albert</h4>
		<p>
			Albert has been one of my best friends since we met working at Purdue together. I have a lot of good memories with Albert, including going on spring break vacation to Florida, helping to renovate his sister's house, and spending lots of time together as we worked our way through grad school. I had the opportunity to move into his place during grad school, and I would say he is a 5-start roommate. I'm thankful to Albert because he has helped me realized how important is it to have fun in your life, and some of my most fun memories have included times that we have shared together. I asked Albert to be one of my groomsman because I always have fun when we see each other, and reconnecting with Albert is always so easy. I'm excited for Albert because he will be getting married in July to a wonderful and kind lady, and I'm so thankful that him and Kirstyn will be able to be here to celebrate with Luisa and me.   
		</p>
	<h4>Cameron</h4>
		<p>
			I first met Cameron when at Purdue, when he would play his harmonica around the civil building. Since then, we have had the chance to grow into good friends. I've gotten to know Cameron well here in Oregon, and I've tagged along on his camping trips, as he's ridden his motorcycle around the nearby Siuslaw National Forest, and as he's perfected his meat-smoking technique. I chose Cameron to be my best man because I admire his kindness and his ability to see the good things in people. Since becoming good friends with Cameron, he has helped me to see the important things in life.
		</p>
	<h4>Connor</h4>
		<p>
			I first met Connor about a year and half ago, shortly after I moved to Oregon. Connor has helped me grow in my faith during the last year, and I'm looking forward to getting out to go target shooting with him sometime soon! I chose Connor to be one of my groomsman because I admire his faith, I am thankful for his invitation to the Newman Center, and I enjoy his friendship.   
		</p>
	<h4>Nate</h4>
		<p>
			Nate is another one of my good friends that I have had so many good times with! From going camping with his family to Yellowstone, living together, chopping down trees, or showing up at his doorstep at 2 am to sleep on his couch as I drive across I drive across the country. I'm thankful for Nate's friendship and all the things that he has taught me. I asked Nate to be one of my groomsman because I always enjoy the times I share with Nate, and I admire how outgoing he is. For sure, I'm looking towards Nate to keep the dance floor going at our ceremony. About a month before our ceremony, Nate and Emilee will be getting married! I would always enjoy when Emilee would come to visit us in West Lafayette, because she helps to bring out his romantic side. I'm thankful that between all their own wedding preparations, honeymoon, and full-time jobs that they were able to find the time to be at our ceremony and celebrate with Luisa and me. 
		</p>
	<h4>Yaghoob</h4>
		<p>
			I very thankful to have met Yaghoob while I was in grad school at Purdue, and since then he has become one of my best friends. We have shared some fun experiences, and I enjoy his sarcastic sense of humor! One my favorite memories was after he moved to a new apartment at Purdue, he had invited a bunch of us over to celebrate. He had made us this special Iranian dish, and really talk it up and made it sound so good. It wasn't until we noticed the box that he told us the truth - it was just Stouffer's lasagna! Yaghoob has also been with me during hard parts of my life, and I will also be thankful to him for his kindness. I asked Yaghoob to be one of my groomsmen because I am thankful to the kindness he has shown me and Luisa, I value the times that we have shared together, and because I always enjoy reconnecting with him.

<h3>Ushers</h3>

	<h4>Chunyu</h4>
		<p>
			I met Chunyu at Purdue, and I'm so happy that we are still able to be together here in Oregon! Luisa and I have become good friends with Chunyu, and he is always a good sport when we prank him! Chunyu has become our impromptu cameraman, capturing some important events in our lives such as our proposal day and surprising our family at Christmas. The family even accidentally mistook him for the pizza delivery guy.
		</p>
	<h4>Hadi</h4>
		<p>
			Hadi is a good friend from Purdue, and I'm thankful for all the help that he has given with managing projects and paperwork since I've been working at OSU. Hadi is another one my friends that always makes sure to get the party turned up, and some of my best memories have been sharing cigars and cooking kebobs with Hadi.
		</p>
	<h4>Nick</h4>
		<p>
			My favorite memories of Nick were the times when Nick and I would come home for lunch, and find Nick asleep on the couch. Many times he would wake up quickly and pretend that he wasn't asleep, but one time we even caught him asleep with McDonalds wrappers all around him. I've had some great experiences with Nick, including fishing on Lake Michigan with him and his dad, chopping down trees at the Brahos farm, and chowing down on BWW while watching football and basketball games at 602 Dodge.
