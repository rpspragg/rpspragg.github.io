	<h4>Cameron</h4>
		<p>
			I first met Cameron when at Purdue, when he would play his harmonica around the civil building. Since then, we have had the chance to grow into good friends. I've gotten to know Camerone well here in Oregon, and I've tagged along on his camping trips, as he's ridden his motorcycle around the nearby Suislaw National Forest, and as he's perfected his meat-smoking technique. I chose Cameron to be my best man because I admire his kindness and authenticity. Since becoming good friends with Cameron, he has helped me to see the important things in life.
