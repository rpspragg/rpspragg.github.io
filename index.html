<h2>Report on the Mobile Infrastructure Materials Testing Laboratory</h2>
	<p class="date">December, 2016</p>
	<p>
	A report co-authored with other members of the Pankow Laboratory at Purdue detailing research related to concrete pavements and pavement patches, internal curing, and asphalt sealing has been published by JTRP. The report detail the use of the Mobile Infrastructure Materials Testing Laboratory to support technology transfer in the State of Indiana. 
	</p>

<h2>Book Chapter on Formation Factor</h2>
	<p class="date">April 1, 2016</p>
	<p>
	The book chapter titled "Asseessing a Concrete’s Resistance to Chloride Ion Ingress Using the Formation Factor” that appears in Corrosion of Steel in Concrete Structures provides an overview of the formation factor and how this microstructural parameter can be used to specify and assess the durability of concrete materials. 
	</p> 
	<p>
	The book was edited by Dr. Amir Poursaee, and is available from Woodhead Publishing / Elsevier <a href="http://store.elsevier.com/Corrosion-of-Steel-in-Concrete-Structures/isbn-9781782423812/">here</a>.

<h2>New Paper on Formation Factor and Effects of Conditioning</h2>
	<p class="date">March 23, 2016</p>
	<p>
	A paper recently published in Advances in Civil Engineering Materials details how different conditioning processes influence electrical measurements, but when accounting for differences such as temperature, maturity, degree of saturation, and pore solution concentration, each different conditioning method provides a consistent formation factor.
	</p>
	<p>
	The paper is available from ASTM International <a href="http://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/ACEM/PAGES/ACEM20150035.htm">here</a>.

<h2>Site Visit to Ohio River Bridges Project</h2>
	<p class="date">September 30, 2015</p>
	<p>
	The Joint Transportation Research Program and the Indiana DOT organized a site-visit to the Ohio River Bridges project. This is $2.3 billion project that will increase the mobility between southern Indiana and Northern Kentucky. The opportunity to visit this historic project was much appreciated, and it was a great experience to see civil engineering in action!

<h2>Pankow Laboratory Participates in First Annual CE Open House</h2>
	<p class="date">September 18, 2015</p>
	<p>
	Members of the Pankow Laboratory participated in the first annual CE Open house that took play on September 18, 2015. This was an opportunity for the entire Lyle's School of Civil Engineering to showcase the breadth of their programs. The program began with a kick-off with Professor Emeritus Harr sharing with us the story of his career.

<h2>Robert and Nate featured for their work with Big Brothers Big Sisters</h2>
	<p class="date">April 14, 2015</p>
	<p>
	Robert and Nate, a MSCE student in Dr. Weiss' research group, were recently featured by the Purdue Exponent for their work with the Greater Lafayette Chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters. BBBS is an organization that pairs mentors with children in the Lafayette community. Robert has been paired with his little brother for more than three years, and they enjoy playing soccer, visiting the Columbian Park Zoo, and singing Mariachi songs.
