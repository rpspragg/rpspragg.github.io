	<b>Potential Interactions between Metalized Structural Steel and Fresh Concrete</b>
	<p>Metalizing describes a process in which molten metal is pneumatically spayed onto the surface of a structural steel element as a form of corrosion protection. These metalized coatings often contain a fraction or are completely aluminum. There has been some concern whether the aluminum could react with the pore solution of a cement-based material, which is typically highly alkaline, and produce hydrogen gas. The production of hydrogen gas can lead to loss of concrete strength and degradation of concrete transport properties. This study was initially planned as literature review, and has transitioned into a laboratory study. Ongoing research is being planned at TFHRC with the goal of providing guidance to transportation agencies that are concerned about metalized coatings and potential interactions with fresh concrete.

	<b>Interface Bond Performance in Precast Bridge Elements</b>
	<p>Accelerated bridge construction relies on precast bridge elements that are assembled on-site. To ensure composite, monolithic behavior, the prefabricated elements are tied together using closure pours, typically consisting of cement-based materials. The study at TFHRC is investigating factors that influence the bond strength with the goal of helping to improve those connections. Additionally, the durability of the bond and the closure pour materials is being investigated. The project is researching five key areas to improve the bond performance. The results of this project will be useful to engineers and transportation agene ices that desire to use prefabricated bridge elements, and will ensure that the joints in these structural systems exhibited the same durability and longevity that is expected from the structural elements.

	<li><b>Development of Performance Grades based upon Variation in Acceptance Quality Characteristics</b>
	<p>This ongoing research investigates the impact of variation in rigid pavement acceptance quality characteristics on pavement life cycle costs, and how unit prices of rigid pavements at time of acceptance could be modified to account for the increase or decrease in life cycle costs. The study used PaveSpec 3.0, a life cycle analysis software available from the Federal Highway Administration, with a series of inputs specific to Indiana pavements. The results indicate that with increases in population AQC variations, life cycle costs increase slightly but there is a significant increase in life cycle cost standard deviations. A methodology to modify pavement unit prices based upon the ninetieth percentile confidence interval of life cycle costs was presented with the concluding pay adjustment factors being applicable to Indiana rigid pavements. The results will be useful to transportation agencies that desire to implement statistically based acceptance procedures for rigid pavements that incorporate pay adjustments that are engineering-based and defensible.

	<li><b>Formation Factor Specification for Durable Concrete</b>
	<p>The formation factor is a material property that provides a numerical description of the pore network volume and connectivity in a porous material. First defined by the oil industry in the 1940’s for oil exploration, my work has sought to bring this into the field of civil engineering. The need rose from the desire to provide a link between easy field measures of material consistency (resistivity) and an estimation of life-cycle (diffusion coefficient). Formation factor and the Nernst-Einstein relationship provide that link. My research has described why the formation factor is better than resistivity for use in specifications, described the parameters needed to accurately determine formation factor from a range of given experimental conditions. I coordinated a multi-agency elaboration study to describe the variation and provide a series of best practices. The primary users of this work are transportation agencies that seeking to implement a formation factor performance specifications and results from this work are currently being balloted through AASHTO for development of a standardized test method.

	<li><b>Observed Variation in Recently Constructed Rigid Pavements</b>
	<p>Variation in pavement construction and pavement materials has long been realized as having an impact on the ultimate quality and longevity of the pavement system. Recognizing this, the Federal Highway Administration has been pushing for statistical-based acceptance procedures for pavements since the early 1980s. My work has investigated the sources of variation in pavement construction, and discussed their contribution to total, measured contribution. The measured, total variation, first characterized by W.A. Shewart in the 1930s, is quantified by the root sum of squares of the components of variation. My work has investigated sources of variation and provided a synthesis of the variation associated with standard test methods. This work investigated variation in acceptance data from nearly a decade of rigid pavement construction performed by a state transportation agency. The primary users of this work are transportation agencies wishing to implement a statistical based acceptance program and desire to inform their performance ranges with the variation seen in full scale pavement construction projects.

	<li><b>Mobile Infrastructure Materials and Testing Laboratory</b>
	<p>The Mobile Infrastructure Materials and Testing Laboratory (MIMTL) was a partnership between industry partners, the Indiana State Department of Transportation, local agencies in the State of Indiana, and researchers at Purdue University. The MIMTL helped to support technology transfer and implementation of field-ready technologies to infrastructure construction throughout the State of Indiana. My work on this project helped to provide technical support to a range of concrete projects including internally cured bridge decks being built by local agencies, rapid pavement repairs that utilized a high early strength concrete and could be open to interstate traffic in less than six hours, and new concrete pavement construction that helped to implement recommendations from nearly two decades of concrete materials research conducted at Purdue researchers. During my time with the MIMTL, work was conducted on a range of construction sites ranging from local roads to high volume interstates with zero accidents or near misses, supporting a culture of safety and providing a vehicle for rapid field-implementation of new technologies.

	<li><b>Resistivity and Resistivity Implementation</b>
	<p>Resistivity testing is gaining in popularity because testing can be conducted very rapidly with modern digital, hand-held units that can be easily transported. First used on concrete in the 1920s by Shimizu, it has been a common laboratory technique for many decades, but some complexities have made it difficult to implement. Along with coordinating Purdue and the Indiana DOT’s participation in an international 2010 multi-laboratory study to determine variability, my research has investigated many factors that influence electrical tests, such as curing and testing temperatures, curing conditions, and geometry. These investigations have led to a better understanding of what factors should be controlled to properly assess material quality, typical levels of variation associated with resistivity testing, and a series of best practices for agencies and research teams looking to use resistivity. The research led to further investigation on the formation factor and implementation efforts with Indiana DOT district testing laboratories led to the draft AASHTO standard on uniaxial resistivity (AASHTO TP119) approved in 2015.

	<li><b>Influence of Solution Properties on Drying and Wetting of Cementitious Materials</b>
	<p>Properties of solutions, most important the water activity, surface tension, and viscosity, are known to influence the transport. This work measured these properties on a range of deicing salt solutions and chemical admixtures in an effort to better characterize their transport. The solution properties were correlated with wetting and drying tests, explaining the slower absorption and slower drying behavior observed with salt solutions. Furthermore, salt solutions, once absorbed, influence subsequent wetting and drying even if those tests are done with water. The implications are that in-service concrete exposed to deicing solutions and subsequently evaluated for wetting or drying behavior should be interpreted with caution. This work has been referenced in ACI 318 with caution to design engineers that concrete exposed to deicing salts can remain at high degrees of saturation, despite atmospheric conditions that would otherwise lead to a drier concrete with a lower risk of corrosion. Furthermore, this work helped to illustrate one of the mechanisms leading to an increased amount of damaged that has been noticed at pavement joints.
