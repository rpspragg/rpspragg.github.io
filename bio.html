	<h3>Biographical Information</h3>
<p>
	Robert has eight years of experience in research related to cementitious materials and rigid pavements. He is currently a concrete structural engineer at SES Group conducting research on cementitious materials at the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center with the structural concrete program under the direction of Dr. Ben Graybeal. Robert obtained his Ph.D. in 2017 from Purdue University under the advisement of the Professor Jason Weiss. Prior to SES Group, he worked as a visiting scholar at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon and a graduate research assistant at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. He has conducted a wide range of research ranging from evaluation of transport properties using the formation factor and diffusion-based life cycle modeling, material related distresses such as alkali silica reaction, salt damage, and plastic shrinkage, and increasing the performance and longevity of concrete through value-added materials such as internal curing and shrinkage reducing admixtures. His current research is related to improving the bond performance between cement-based materials that are used with prefabricated bridge elements and in investigating interactions between fresh cement-based materials and aluminum-based coatings for structural steel elements. His contributions have been documented in more than thirty scholarly publications. Robert has affected change in construction specifications with research that has included multi-laboratory studies, numerical simulations, and experimental techniques. Robert is a member of the Durability of Concrete Committee (AFN 30) of the Transportation Research Board and is licensed Engineer Intern (IN).
